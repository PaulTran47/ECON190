  abstract = {This paper evaluates the effects of fiscal policy on investment using a panel of OECD
countries. In particular, we investigate how different types of fiscal policy affect profits and , as a
result, investment.

We find a sizable negative effect of public spending -- and in particular of its public wage
component -- on business investment. This result is consistent with models in which government
employment creates wage pressure for the private sector. Various types of taxes also have negative
effects on profits, but, interestingly, the effects of government spending on investment are larger than
the effect of taxes. Our results have important implications for the so called “non-Keynesian” (i.e.
expansionary) effects of fiscal adjustments.},

We find that firms that appear less financially constrained exhibit significantly greater sensitivities than firms that appear more financially constrained. We find this pattern for the entire sample period, subperiods, and individual years. These results (and simple theoretical arguments) suggest that higher sensitivities cannot be interpreted as evidence that firms are more financially constrained. These findings call into question the interpretation of most previous research that uses this methodology.},

  abstract = {In this paper, the relation of concentration to profit rates is examined with the help of new data for a sample of 507 manufacturing firms. Specifically, these data make it possible to distinguish between specialized and diversified firms. For the latter, measures of concentration relate to the entire range of a firm's activities rather than merely to its primary activity.

Using several measures of the profit rate, the results obtained consistently show that there is no clear single-variate relation between concentration and the level of profits. Indeed, the industry in which the firm operates exerts only a weak influence on the differences in profit rates among firms. However, the profit rates of firms in the more concentrated industries show a substantially higher serial correlation. The latter result is attributed to high exit as well as entry barriers in the concentrated industries.},

abstract ={Business cycles affect the economic and business life prospects of firms anywhere; but alas literatures in management and strategy have persistently developed theories and empirical models that overlook how they affect competitive dynamics and competitive advantages. Within the cycle, economic recessions represent periods of reduced environmental munificence on the business cycle of non-industry specific genesis and of transitory nature that affect the survivability of all firms in an industry. This downturn event is, for these reasons, of especial interest to strategists and managers. Rooted in evolutionary economics, our work aims to provide insights on the conditions that allow companies to take advantage of business cycles, with an empirical emphasis in its downside portion, i.e., recessions. We specifically ground a case discussion of shifts in the competitive positioning of rivals in the US Automobile industry. Further, we formally model the dynamics of competition, and explore its nuances through multiple mathematical simulation runs, so that we derive general theoretical propositions. In specific, we propose that the depth and duration of an economic recession monotonically reinforce “supply-side” cost leadership capabilities. Also, we conjecture that the duration of a recession has more lasting effects the earlier it happens in an industry life cycle.

The results show that competition among brewers is greater during periods associated with significant negative shocks to demand, lower observed de- mand, lower expected future industry profit, and lower advertising.},

 abstract = {This paper presents some empirical models of profitability, using panel data covering 709 large UK companies over the 1970s and 1980s focusing specifically on the role of aggregate demand shocks in shaping firm-level profitability. In basic regressions and in quite complex econometric models the results suggest that firm-level profit margins fell heavily during the deep manufacturing recession of the early 1980s and, as such, are consistent with models predicting the procyclical nature of profit margins. This result holds across different product groups (producer goods, consumer durables and non-durables), though the timing of the impact of aggregate shocks appears to differ.},

 abstract = {We present a model of investment hangover motivated by the Great Recession. In our model, overbuilding of residential capital requires a reallocation of productive resources to nonresidential sectors, which is facilitated by a reduction in the real interest rate. If the fall in the interest rate is limited by the zero
lower bound and nominal rigidities, then the economy enters a liquidity trap with limited reallocation and low output. The drop in output reduces nonresidential investment through a mechanism similar
to the acceleration principle of investment. The burst in nonresidential investment is followed by an even greater boom due to low interest rates during the liquidity trap. The boom in nonresidential investment
induces a partial and asymmetric recovery in which the residential sector is left behind, consistent with the broad trends of the Great Recession.},
